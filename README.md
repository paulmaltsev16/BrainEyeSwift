## Stack
Swift, SwiftUI, Clean Architecture, MVVM, Charts, Dark/Light mode

## Summary
The application tracks the reaction time and accuracy of the user's pupils. This data is displayed on the screen in the form of two graphs.

## Implemented Features
The application sends a request to the server to fetch the latest data on the user's reaction time and accuracy. It uses asynchronous methods to retrieve the data, and the Clean Architecture ensures that the data is displayed on the screen in two tabs. The MVVM pattern is used, and the SwiftUI framework displays the SwiftUI Chart.
